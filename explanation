Basic extensions:
•	Buying tickets should decrease the funds of the customer by the price
--SELECT  (funds - price) AS Remaining_Balance from tickets WHERE customers.name = "Fred" AND films.title = 'Armagedon '

•	Check how many tickets were bought by a customer

cinema=# SELECT COUNT(*) from customers;
 count
-------
     2
(1 row)

cinema=# SELECT COUNT(*) from customers WHERE name = 'Fred';
 count
-------
     1
(1 row)


•	Check how many customers are going to watch a certain film

JOIN TABLE PROBABLY

Advanced extensions:
•	Create a screenings table that lets us know what time films are showing
  CREATE A TABLE OF SHOW TIMES AND THEN JOIN IT WITH films and customers TABLES USING THE PK


  
•	Write a method that finds out what is the most popular time (most tickets sold) for a given film
•	Limit the available tickets for screenings.
•	Add any other extensions you think would be great to have at a cinema!
